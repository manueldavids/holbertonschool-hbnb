"""
Base API class for common CRUD operations.
Provides reusable patterns for API endpoints.

# This file previously used Flask Blueprint and add_url_rule for CRUD operations.
# All Blueprint-based code should be removed. If generic CRUD logic is needed, refactor as RESTX Resource base classes or mixins.
# If not needed, this file can be deleted.

# (No Blueprint or add_url_rule code should remain)
